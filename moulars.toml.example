## OPTIONAL: The path to the data server root.  See README.md for details
## on how to populate it and generate manifests.
#data_root = "./data"

## OPTIONAL: The Build ID that clients should use to connect to this server.
#build_id = 918

## OPTIONAL: Set to true to restrict logins to only Admins and Beta Testers
#restrict_logins = false

[server]
## OPTIONAL: The local address to listen on for Lobby server connections.
## NOTE: To listen on any available external network, set this to "0.0.0.0".
## The default value of "127.0.0.1" will ONLY allow connections from
## localhost, which is not very useful for a public-facing server.
#listen_address = "127.0.0.1"

## OPTIONAL: The port to listen on for Lobby server connections.
## Unless you've modified the client to use a different port, or are doing
## some creative routing, you should probably leave this at the default.
#listen_port = 14617

## OPTIONAL: The external-facing addresses of the file/auth/game servers.
## These will be sent to the client, so they need to be resolvable outside
## the server's network.  Using the default localhost address is only useful
## for testing with the client and server running on the same machine.
#file_server_ip = "127.0.0.1"
#auth_server_ip = "127.0.0.1"
#game_server_ip = "127.0.0.1"

## OPTIONAL: The local address to listen on for API access.  By default,
## this is only open to localhost.  MOULArs doesn't support any TLS/SSL on
## the API, so you probably want to proxy this behind a real web server if
## you want the API to be available externally.
#api_address = "127.0.0.1"
#api_port = 14615

[crypt_keys]
## REQUIRED: The private and shared keys to use for encrypted server channels.
## These values are big endian Base64-encoded 512 bit keys.
## NOTE: These should be generated with "moulars --keygen".  They can also be
## copied from an existing dirtsand.ini, although note the different setting
## parameter names (e.g. "auth.n" vs "Key.Auth.N")
auth.n = "..."
auth.k = "..."
game.n = "..."
game.k = "..."
gate.n = "..."
gate.k = "..."

[vault_db]
## OPTIONAL: The database backend to use for the Vault.
## "none" - Use an in-memory temporary backend.  This is only useful for
##          testing and development, since it means vault and account data
##          are not kept after the server shuts down or crashes.
## "sqlite" - Use an SQLite file for data storage.  This allows for very
##          simple server setup and maintenance, but probably won't scale
##          as well for large servers and deployments.
## "postgres" - Use a PostgreSQL database for data storage.  This is the
##          option most compatible with DirtSand, and has the best performance
##          and scalability, but it is also the most complex to set up and
##          maintain.
#db_type = "none"
