MOULArs Internal API Help

The following endpoints are available:
  /
  /account/api_tokens [a]
  /account/new
  /client_keys
  /online
  /shutdown [a,!]
  /status

Key:
  a = Requires authentication via an API token
  ! = Restricted to ADMIN accounts (via API token)

Authentication:
  Authenticated APIs can be accessed by passing an API token in the request URI
  as a query parameter (e.g. /shutdown?token=<TOKEN>), or in a request header
  (e.g. "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>").

  When using curl, this can be set with the -H option:
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" http://localhost:14615/shutdown


API Endpoints:

GET /
  Returns this help message.

GET /account/api_tokens[?account=<UUID>]
  Returns a JSON object containing the API tokens associated with the account.
  If account is not specified, the account associated with the authorization
  API token is used.  Only ADMIN accounts can view API keys for other accounts.

  Example:
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" http://localhost:14615/api_tokens
    [{"token":"XXXX","comment":"Test Token"}]

POST /account/new
  Body: JSON object containing the username and password for the new account.

  Creates a new account with the specified parameters.  Returns a JSON object
  containing the Account UUID for the newly created account, if successful.
  If an account with the requested username already exists, this returns a
  409 Conflict error.

  If this endpoint is called with an ADMIN API token, an optional "account_flags"
  object can also be included in the request object.  This should be an array
  containing one or more of the following flag strings:
    "admin"  The account will be given administrative privileges.
    "banned" The account will be prevented from logging in.
    "beta"   The account will be given "beta tester" status, and can log in
             even when login restrictions are in enabled.

  Example:
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"username":"Test Account","password":"TestPa55word"}' \
         http://localhost:14615/account/new
    {"status":"ok","account_id":"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"}

GET /client_keys
  Returns the public encryption keys for use by clients, in server.ini format.

GET /online
  Returns a JSON object containing the names and locations of online players.

  Example:
    curl http://localhost:14615/online
    [{"name":"Test Player","location":"Test Player's Relto"}]

POST /shutdown
  Shuts down the server gracefully.

  Example:
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_TOKEN>" http://localhost:14615/shutdown
    {"status":"ok"}

GET /status
  Returns "OK" if the API service is running.
