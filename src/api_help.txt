MOULArs Internal API Help

The following endpoints are available:
  /
  /api_tokens
  /client_keys [a]
  /online
  /shutdown [a,!]
  /status

Key:
  a = Requires authentication via an API token
  ! = Restricted to ADMIN accounts (via API token)

Authentication:
  Authenticated APIs can be accessed by passing an API token in the request URI,
  as a query parameter (e.g. /shutdown?token=<TOKEN>), or in the request header
  (e.g. Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>).

  When using curl, this can be set with the -H option:
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" http://localhost:14615/shutdown
